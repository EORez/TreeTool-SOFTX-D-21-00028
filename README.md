# NISTTreeDetector

An important goal for our team is to assess the carbon content in trees. With that goal in mind, we have created models to detect trees in the wild and measure their diameters at brest height (1.3 m). This document describes the requirements, installation and how to run our code to detect trees and measure their diameter at breast height. As input, we have a cloud of points.


# Install Anaconda
Anaconda is a package manager system that may make you life easier with your setup. If you do not have it installed in your system, you may want to download it and install it from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual/get-started



# Create a Virtual Environment

This may be useful to isolate the package installation to your current system setup.

Create a virtual environment, called venv, under the current directory and use python as your interpreter

```
python -m venv --system-site-packages .\venv
```

To activate the virtual environment run
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Before installing packages in the virtual environment, upgrade pip with the command that run pip as a library module of python

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip 

python -m pip list  # show packages installed within the virtual environment
```








# Requirements for Installation

Run the following commands to make sure you have the required pieces of software

* conda install jupyter 
* conda config --add channels conda-forge
* pip install opencv-contrib-python
* conda install laspy
* conda install -c conda-forge pdal python-pdal gdal
* conda install -c sirokujira python-pcl
* pip install pclpy
* conda install matplotlib
* conda install pandas
* conda install -c anaconda scipy
